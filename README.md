## DNA edit-distance

Repository for the class CS6219: DNA-Based Data Storage and Computation


###Project:
The clustering algorithm covered in class [1] creates binary embeddings of DNA reads
based on q-grams and uses the Hamming distance between such embeddings to
approximate the edit distance between the original DNA reads. Instead of such a static
and data-agnostic approach, one could try to learn more appropriate embeddings
through deep learning. The goal of this project is to design and evaluate learned
embeddings that achieve higher accuracy than q-gram-based embeddings and allow
for more efficient filtering of edit distance computation.
